## _A very rudimentary browser-based video blackjack game_

This is a blackjack game that performs the basic game functions. 
There are buttons to hit and stand, as well as initiate a new hand. 
It will calculate the proper hand value, evaluate to see if an Ace 
needs to be reduced in value, and determine the winner based upon a 
comparison of hand values.

- Correct cards don't always display (happens a lot with diamonds suit)
- Screen must be refreshed after hitting New Hand button in order to get the cards to display
- Betting is fixed at 10 units right now
